EJS Views 

keeps views in folder 
views to work need to [No default engine was specified ] set default engine
Failed to lookup view "user-registeration" in views directory
    by default it will look for view in apps' root's view directory (spendly\views)
    import path
    app.set("views",path.join(path.resolve(),"src","views"));
use layout for uniform pages
    - this will have boostrap
    - this will have link to our own js and css 
    - we need a middleware for using layouts
        - import ejsLayouts from "express-ejs-layouts"
        -app.use(ejsLayouts)
        -make layout.ejs in Views
    static files:
        app.use(express.static("public"))
        without it we cant use static files
        now we can place out css,js and images in public folder
        browser will automatically read it from there no need for routing
        eg : <a href:"/images/image1.jpeg" ></a> will work on browser 
        if our public/images/image1.jpeg is there in root directory

Req.Body :
 needs to be parsed else will give error 
 Cannot destructure property 'name' of 'req.body' as it is undefined.
 app.use(express.json());
Form data:
  enctype="multipart/form-data"
  dont add this if your not using photo ro file upload -else it gives empty respense
  name field in the form, decieds the name of the property at backend 

  app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}))
  need this else form data wont be parsed, empty form data will be there
Designin the tags
    we need html,css and JS for designing the feauture of picking tags


important to return
res.render() - > doesnt end the function and the code below it exute


Challenge of laying out all the expense by month
I have come up with an idea of - having a field in expense schema for MonthYear
and simply filtering by month year or grouping by it 

Date.now() - is a number not a Date
so .getFullYear() and other function doesnt work on this 
new Date() -> creates a date object and it has current date and time
